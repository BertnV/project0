/*
Fields to hold the user's data: id, username, and password.
A no-argument constructor for instantiation without setting any properties.
A parameterized constructor to set the username and password.
Getter and setter methods to access and modify the user's fields.
In your application, this class is used as the model object that gets passed around.
For example, the UserController and UserService classes will work with User objects,
as seen in the code youâ€™ve shared earlier, to interact with the database or handle HTTP requests.
